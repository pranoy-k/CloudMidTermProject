T@@ he first series of experiments examined the influence of age and growth status on artery cal@@ ci@@ fication in W@@ ar@@ far@@ in -@@ treated rat@@ s. T@@ re@@ at@@ ment for 2 weeks with W@@ ar@@ far@@ in caused massive focal cal@@ ci@@ fication of the artery media in 20@@ -@@ day@@ -@@ old rats and less extensive focal cal@@ ci@@ fication in 4@@ 2@@ -@@ day@@ -@@ old rat@@ s. I@@ n contra@@ st@@ , no artery cal@@ ci@@ fication could be detected in 10@@ -@@ mon@@ th@@ -@@ old adult rats even after 4 weeks of W@@ ar@@ far@@ in treat@@ men@@ t. T@@ o directly examine the importance of growth to W@@ ar@@ far@@ in -@@ induced artery cal@@ ci@@ fication in animals of the same ag@@ e@@ , 20@@ -@@ day@@ -@@ old rats were fed for 2 weeks either an ad li@@ bit@@ um diet or a 6@@ -@@ g@@ /@@ d restricted diet that maintains weight but prevents grow@@ th@@ . C@@ on@@ current treatment of both di@@ etary groups with W@@ ar@@ far@@ in produced massive focal cal@@ ci@@ fication of the artery media in the ad li@@ bit@@ um@@ -@@ fed rats but no detectable artery cal@@ ci@@ fication in the restri@@ c@@ ted@@ -@@ di@@ et@@ , grow@@ th@@ -@@ inhibited grou@@ p. A@@ l@@ though the explanation for the association between artery cal@@ ci@@ fication and growth status can@@ not be determined from the present stu@@ dy@@ , there was a relationship between higher serum phosp@@ hate and suscepti@@ bility to artery cal@@ ci@@ fication , with 30@@ % higher levels of serum phosp@@ hate in young@@ , ad li@@ bit@@ um@@ -@@ fed rats compared with either of the groups that was resistant to W@@ ar@@ far@@ in -@@ induced artery cal@@ ci@@ fication , ie@@ , the 10@@ -@@ mon@@ th@@ -@@ old rats and the restri@@ c@@ ted@@ -@@ di@@ et@@ , grow@@ th@@ -@@ inhibited young rat@@ s. T@@ his observation suggests that increased suscepti@@ bility to W@@ ar@@ far@@ in -@@ induced artery cal@@ ci@@ fication could be related to higher serum phosp@@ hate le@@ vel@@ s. T@@ he second set of experiments examined the possible sy@@ ner@@ gy between vitamin D and W@@ ar@@ far@@ in in artery cal@@ ci@@ fication . H@@ igh doses of vitamin D are known to cause cal@@ ci@@ fication of the artery media in as little as 3 to 4 day@@ s. H@@ igh doses of the vitamin K antag@@ onist W@@ ar@@ far@@ in are also known to cause cal@@ ci@@ fication of the artery medi@@ a@@ , but at treatment times of 2 weeks or longer yet not at 1 week@@ . I@@ n the current stu@@ dy@@ , we investigated the sy@@ ner@@ gy between these 2 treatments and found that con@@ current W@@ ar@@ far@@ in administration dramatically increased the extent of cal@@ ci@@ fication in the media of vitamin D -@@ treated rats at 3 and 4 day@@ s. T@@ here was a close parallel between the effect of vitamin D dose on artery cal@@ ci@@ fication and the effect of vitamin D dose on the elevation of serum cal@@ ci@@ um , which suggests that vitamin D may induce artery cal@@ ci@@ fication through its effect on serum cal@@ ci@@ um . B@@ e@@ cause W@@ ar@@ far@@ in treatment had no effect on the elevation in serum cal@@ ci@@ um produced by vitamin D , the sy@@ ner@@ gy between W@@ ar@@ far@@ in and vitamin D is probably best explained by the hypothesis that W@@ ar@@ far@@ in inhi@@ bits the activity of matrix G@@ la protein as a cal@@ ci@@ fication inhi@@ bit@@ or@@ . H@@ igh levels of matrix G@@ la protein are found at sites of artery cal@@ ci@@ fication in rats treated with vitamin D plus W@@ ar@@ far@@ in , and chemical analysis showed that the protein that accumulated was indeed not gam@@ ma@@ -@@ car@@ box@@ y@@ lated . T@@ he@@ se observations indicate that although the gam@@ ma@@ -@@ car@@ box@@ y@@ glu@@ ta@@ mate resi@@ dues of matrix G@@ la protein are apparently required for its function as a cal@@ ci@@ fication inhi@@ bit@@ or@@ , they are not required for its accu@@ mul@@ ation at cal@@ ci@@ fication sit@@ es@@ .

H@@ ow@@ ever@@ , the observation that antagoni@@ sts of the glu@@ ta@@ mate N@@ -@@ methy@@ l@@ -@@ D@@ -@@ a@@ spar@@ tate ( N@@ M@@ D@@ A ) recep@@ tor produce schizophrenic -@@ like symptoms in humans has led to the idea of a dys@@ functioning of the glu@@ ta@@ mat@@ er@@ gic system via its N@@ M@@ D@@ A recep@@ tor@@ . A@@ s a resul@@ t@@ , there is a growing interest in the development of pharmac@@ ological agents with potential anti@@ psychotic properties that enhance the activity of the glu@@ ta@@ mat@@ er@@ gic system via a mo@@ dul@@ ation of the N@@ M@@ D@@ A recep@@ tor@@ . A@@ m@@ ong them are gly@@ c@@ ine transpor@@ ter@@ -@@ 1 (@@ G@@ ly@@ T@@ 1@@ ) inhi@@ bit@@ ors such as S@@ S@@ R@@ 10@@ 3@@ 800 , which indirectly enhance N@@ M@@ D@@ A recep@@ tor function by increasing the gly@@ c@@ ine (@@ a co@@ -@@ ag@@ onist for the N@@ M@@ D@@ A recep@@ tor@@ ) levels in the synap@@ se@@ . T@@ his study aimed at investigating the potential anti@@ psycho@@ ti@@ c@@ -@@ like properties of S@@ S@@ R@@ 10@@ 3@@ 800 , with a particular focus on models of hyper@@ activity , involving either drug challenge (@@ ie@@ , amp@@ he@@ ta@@ mine and M@@ K@@ -@@ 8@@ 01 ) or trans@@ genic mice (@@ ie@@ , N@@ M@@ D@@ A N@@ r@@ 1@@ (@@ ne@@ o@@ -@@ /@@ -@@ ) and D@@ A@@ T@@ (@@ -@@ /@@ -@@ )@@ )@@ .

W@@ e measured the plasma level of brain nat@@ ri@@ u@@ re@@ tic pe@@ p@@ tide (@@ B@@ N@@ P@@ ) to determine whether B@@ N@@ P might serve as a simple diagno@@ stic indicator of an@@ thr@@ ac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine -@@ induced cardi@@ o@@ toxic@@ ity in patients with acute leu@@ ke@@ mia treated with a daun@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in ( D@@ N@@ R )@@ -@@ containing regi@@ men@@ .
